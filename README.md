# RandomColors.js
I developed these functions because it is impossible to color elements inside of tags individually using css.<br>
This library wraps all elements in <span> tags and then colors them in different schemes<br>
just add the color scheme name in the class of the section you want, and done!<br>
-Check out index.html to see these guys in action<br>
**Enjoy!**
